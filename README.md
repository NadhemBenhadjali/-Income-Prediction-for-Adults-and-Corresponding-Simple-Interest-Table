# -Income-Prediction-for-Adults-and-Corresponding-Simple-Interest-Table
Income Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 using Machine Learning techniques. The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from Kaggle.com, containing various attributes that can help in predicting income levels. The prediction model is built using Python and popular ML libraries like scikit-learn.

Usage
Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
Steps
Data Collection: Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project's data directory.

Data Preprocessing: Execute the Jupyter Notebook data_preprocessing.ipynb to clean, preprocess, and prepare the dataset for the ML model.

Machine Learning Model: Run the income_prediction_model.ipynb notebook to build, train, and evaluate the Machine Learning model for income prediction. The model aims to classify whether an individual's income will be above or below $50,000 based on the given features.

Interest Calculation: After predicting income levels, the notebook simple_interest_calculation.ipynb demonstrates how to generate a table of simple interest based on user-defined time periods and interest rates using the predicted income data.
